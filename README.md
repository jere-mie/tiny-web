# Tiny-Web

This is a repository of a bunch of different static web apps I've made using simple HTML, CSS, and JS. The purpose of it is to have one place for me to put all of these small projects, as opposed to making a repository for each.

You can check out all of the web pages [here](https://tiny.bornais.ca)
