        <h3>A little about this project</h3>
        <p>Originally, this project was made to be a collection of simple retro-themed web pages I created. However, as I started to add new 
            sites I began to break out of that original vision. I began to make things that are actually useful, and that I wanted to actually
            look good and work well on mobile. Therefore, I renamed this project to the Tiny Web Collection, where I keep all of the small, fun, 
            non-serious projects that aren't big enough to be included as their own repo on GitHub. 
        </p>
        <p>I am also using this as an opportunity to test out my personal CSS framework, 
            <a href="https://github.com/jere-mie/bornais-css">Bornais.css</a>, (not used on this page or all pages), as well as try out fun, small 
            interactive ways to incorporate javascript in my projects.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the purpose of this project is NOT to write good, beautiful, or efficient code. This is simply a free place to create small,
            hacky, or ugly projects, and do so with pride. Don't take this project to seriously.
        </p>

        <h3>Here was the original description of this project:</h3>
        <p>this is a simple repository containing small websites and projects I make in an effort to bring back the old spirit of just putting something out
            there on the web, or just making something fun/interesting. The idea started out when I thought of making some simple, dumb 'love calculator'
            website using basic javascript, and I thought why not make an entire repo dedicated to little, fun things like this.
            <br>
            The objective of this is not to make anything too serious or anything that looks good, but rather to bring back the old magic of having
            your own corner of the internet that you made yourself.
        </p>
